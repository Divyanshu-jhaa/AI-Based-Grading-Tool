I received the product today, and I tried filing a return request as the size is smaller than the one I had ordered, and the cloth is torn on the left side. For some reason, the return request is not being filed. The page is either getting redirected or stuck. I have tried multiple times, and I could not go through with it. Can you please check and let me know if the return request has been filed for the order no. 3049. If not, kindly let me know what I should do to return the product.\r\n\r\nI am attaching herewith photographs of the damaged portion of the top and the opening video for your reference.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nSignature\r\n\r\nSunidhi Mishra\r\n",

I would be thrilled if you could give me some advice on it. \r\n\r\n \r\nI have written a book on the topic of the Dalit issue, casting a Dalit woman as a goddess in an area. The book talks about how she is considered a god because people believe their wishes are fulfilled if they donate to her. However, the reality is deeply harrowing. I have discovered her inner emotions and have written the book from a third-person point of view. \r\n\r\n \r\nI would request you to please read my book synopsis and manuscript which I have attached with this email. \r\n\r\n \r\nHoping to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\n \r\nYours Faithfully,\r\n\r\nSneha Jogi\r\n",

The majority of accidents are caused by speed freaks who then flee the scene, leaving the injured and distraught. They knock someone to the ground and then run away before anyone can write down the number and model of their automobiles. They no longer possess any human decency and believe that the road is their private property. Careless drivers pass on from the left side to overtake while breaking all traffic laws. They have no understanding of traffic signals. Traffic lights and other things are just some mere jokes for them. The fines levied for irresponsible driving are too low to have any real impact. The time has come to punish offenders severely. After striking someone, a careless driver who speeds off should be required to serve at least one year in a cell after being apprehended by authorities.\r\n\r\n \r\nI will be very grateful if you would consider giving my opinions a pertinent spot in your esteemed daily newspaper.\r\n\r\n \r\nThanking You \r\n\r\nYours Sincerely\r\n\r\nPrem Gupta\r\n",

We are currently experiencing a severe pandemic, and many of us are unemployed or working from home, making it feel taboo to leave the house. As a result, a lot of people who used to feed stray animals in our neighbourhood have ceased doing so, especially in light of the propagation of untrue information that covid may spread through animals. As a result, many of these stray animals are going hungry and dying; if we do nothing, the pandemic may continue to claim more lives.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe people of our nation and the rest of the world are therefore requested to step up and ensure that these animals are fed through the pages of your renowned newspaper in order to help them survive this difficult condition.\r\n\r\n \r\nThanking You \r\n\r\nYours Faithfully\r\n\r\nShyam Sharma\r\n",

With the aid of your prestigious newspaper's columns, I would like to bring this matter out in the open.\r\n\r\n \r\nFace masks are being used by more and more people to protect themselves from the disease as a result of the worries about the spread of COVID-19 and the government's considerable efforts to raise awareness about the need for protective measures. While this is a wonderful thing, there is a problem when people carelessly dump these masks in locations like water bodies and roadside ditches because they are unaware of the potential harm they might do.\r\n\r\nBecause it increases the likelihood that someone will become infected by accidently coming into contact with it, I would like to make a plea to the citizens of our nation through the pages of your prestigious publication. Instead, masks should be disposed of safely and at approved locations.\r\n\r\n \r\nThanking You \r\n\r\nYours Sincerely\r\n\r\nVed Patel\r\n",

Congratulations!\r\n\r\nI know it is not easy to get a good job in this troubled job market. It is particularly tough for a fresh graduate with hardly any work experience. The resourcefulness you displayed in your job search is commendable. You have inspired me and a lot others that “Where there is a will, there is definitely a way.” You have made us all proud, Vishnu!\r\n\r\nI am quite confident that your knowledge of computer and artistic skills will make you a great graphics designer. I expect to hear great news coming from your direction in the coming years. May you fulfil all your dreams.\r\n\r\nBest wishes.\r\n\r\nYours truly\r\n\r\nSara/ Sid\r\n",

I am writing you this letter to tell you how proud I am of you. I read your novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Well done!\r\n\r\nThe speech and the flow in which it is written is commendable. I really liked your choice of words. I know that most of your books are inspired from actual life experiences, and this book clearly demonstrates how committed and hard-working you've been. It is doing absolute justice to what you've gone through and how well you have handled it.\r\n\r\nMy friend, since you left for Bangalore to pursue your writing career, we have drifted apart, unfortunately. I hope we can start a correspondence here and meet soon one day.\r\n\r\nHope you fulfill your dreams. Remember, sky's the limit.\r\n\r\nYours lovingly",
