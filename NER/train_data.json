            "Shivaji Nagar\r\nPune\r\n12th June 2023\r\n\r\nThe Editor\r\nJan Chetna\r\nPune\r\n\r\nSubject: concern about the increase in number of road mishaps\r\n\r\nSir/Madam\r\n\r\nI, XYZ, a responsible citizen of Pune, would like to bring your attention to the rising number of road mishaps in my neighbourhood. The roads are becoming a death trap in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe root-cause of these collisions appears to be irresponsible and hasty driving. People nowadays live in a mechanised world and are usually in a rush. The speed-barriers and accident-prone-area-warnings are ignored. They are not concerned regarding their wellbeing or the regulations of the road. Another factor contributing to these collisions is the growth in the number of automobiles on the road. Today's youth yearn for their own automobile. The majority of risky driving is done by young people who are also reckless drivers.\r\n\r\nI would like to request the authorities, through the prestigious columns of your publication, to take appropriate stern action against lawbreakers. Through public awareness programmes, make people aware about traffic rules, the significance of speed-barriers, and speed restrictions, so that roads become a safe place for everyone who uses them.\r\n\r\nThanking you\r\n\r\nYours sincerely\r\nXYZ\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I want to inform you that face masks, which are widely used for safety against Covid-19, are being discarded in inappropriate locations by a segment of the population.\r\n\r\nFace masks are being worn by a growing number of individuals to be safe from the disease, but disposing them away anywhere is not acceptable as it can cause many health related as well as environmental issues. People dump these masks carelessly in places like roadsides, pavements, gardens, etc. The elastic bands on these can pose death threat for the animals who mindlessly chew them. Also, these are a hub of germs and microbes and can spread infections. Proper disposal of face masks is crucial for prevention of spread of diseases. \r\n\r\nI would like to request the residents, through the columns of your prestigious publication to stop careless discarding of their used masks. The government agencies should sensitize people regarding this issue.\r\n\r\nThanking you in anticipation\r\n\r\nYours sincerely\r\nABC\r\n\r\n",

I would like to bring to light a few problems faced by the students at the University.\r\n\r\nThere is a lack of clarity regarding our curriculum because of which there have been frequent differences between the students and the faculty in recent months. Students are not notified about critical dates, which puts them under more stress. The teachers are not discussing all the topics and so students are facing difficulties while attempting the exams.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if you address this concern in one of your columns in order to improve departmental efficiency.

Physically, the elderly are often frail. As a result, they can't face the rogues who usually come to rob them.\r\n\r\nAny opposition from the elderly can be dangerous to their wellbeing. Many incidences of robbery, pickpocketing, and severe attacks on the elderly have occurred in the Safdarjung Area. Recently, an old aged couple was hacked to death in broad daylight. This has created fear among the seniors.\r\n\r\nIt is the government's responsibility to safeguard the lives of senior residents. I suggest that the resident welfare associations should form small groups which visit the lonely couples a few times a day and keep a check on their wellbeing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there has been no action despite many inquiries and requests to the authorities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the words in your prestigious publication will do the needful.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nYours truly\r\nNaresh\r\n\r\n",

Because of man's avarice, many wild animal species are on the verge of extinction. Animals, like humans, have the right to live and also contribute to ecological balance. Despite the fact that the government has launched numerous programmes aimed at protecting wild animals, no positive results have been achieved. Some people keep pet animals but do not take proper care of them. This is not called for and government agencies should create laws to check and prevent such incidents. Many private organizations are making efforts but legal intervention will make strict implementation of rules.\r\n\r\nKindly publish this letter so that we can create awareness among the masses. \r\n\r\nThanking you\r\nYours faithfully\r\n\r\nNeena\r\n\r\n\r\n",

What astounds me the most is the city authorities' attitude to the provision and protection of these monuments.\r\n\r\nThese monuments are not only priceless icons of our civilization's past, but also a very lucrative source of revenue for both the local and national economies. These historic structures contribute to the development of dynamic, cultural downtowns that encourage tourism, art, events, and other activities that encourage businesses, income, and economic growth. These structures' damaged areas must be refurbished and restored. Tourists should be able to observe these buildings from a slight distance and so these should be surrounded by fencing. Installing CCTV cameras, keeping guards on duty, maintaining cleanliness, and giving some tourist amenities are all things that should be considered. The immediate surroundings of these establishments have become quite unsanitary due to the lack of washrooms.\r\n\r\nI request to the appropriate Ministry and local authorities to investigate the situation and take appropriate action. This can be achieved if you highlight the problem through the columns of your renowned newspaper. \r\n\r\nThanking you\r\nYours truly\r\nJasveen\r\n\r\n",

This is a highly contagious infectious disease and if timely action is not taken, it will spread magnanimously.\r\n\r\nSeeing the situation of the people in our locality, I request the government to take action. Animals should be treated with proper medication and those infected should be quarantined.\r\n\r\nI hope you will share my request in your reputable newspaper as soon as possible, alerting the government about the situation in the area.\r\n\r\nThanking You\r\nYours Faithfully\r\nChirsty\r\n\r\n",

This programme would be extremely beneficial for all students. It offers health management methods. Learners were also taught how to deal with academic pressure. We were made aware of the importance of nature, mental well being,  real life social interaction, harms of social media and and ill effects of device use.\r\n\r\nIn a word, I believe that every student should sign up for such courses. Such programmes should be made known to students, and the administration, in association with all schools should organize such workshops.\r\n\r\nThanking you\r\nYours Truly\r\nKanika\r\n\r\n",

If you could give my views a tiny room in your esteemed daily, I would be grateful.\r\n\r\nCybercrime has become a major menace to the digital society, and the victims are none other than ourselves. The internet is the sole source of information in today's world. Everything is digital nowadays, from the work-from-home or attending courses and seminars online. This online form, however, has also provided a new opportunity for hackers. They're lurking at every corner, waiting to pounce on someone's email or bank account. Cybercrime has now gotten out of hand. We urgently want stringent cyber regulations and public knowledge of the numerous sorts of cybercrime.\r\n\r\nThere are several options for keeping our sensitive information private on the internet, including tailored privacy settings and encryption. If individuals are aware of their actions, the chances of being hacked are reduced. In addition, robust cyber law and enforcement are required to ensure that such offenders are punished and that victims receive justice.\r\n\r\nI genuinely hope that my concerns will cause people to consider the potential hazards of cybercrime and that they will take further measures when using the internet in the future.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely\r\n\r\nChahat\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I am writing you this letter to tell you how proud I am of you. I read your novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Well done!\r\n\r\nThe speech and the flow in which it is written is commendable. I really liked your choice of words. I know that most of your books are inspired from actual life experiences, and this book clearly demonstrates how committed and hard-working you've been. It is doing absolute justice to what you've gone through and how well you have handled it.\r\n\r\nMy friend, since you left for Bangalore to pursue your writing career, we have drifted apart, unfortunately. I hope we can start a correspondence here and meet soon one day.\r\n\r\nHope you fulfill your dreams. Remember, sky's the limit.\r\n\r\nYours lovingly\r\nRobina\r\n\r\n",

When I visited last week, you seemed a little bit depressed.\r\n\r\nCome on boy, you should thank God for giving you a fresh lease of life. Everything is going to be fine very soon. I even talked to your doctor this morning and he told me that you are out of danger now.\r\n\r\nYou will have to remain in the hospital for a few more days but that is not something you should be concerned about. Your family and friends are there for you.\r\n\r\nDon't forget that life is a mixture of joys and sorrows. By the way, all of us have decided to celebrate your recovery as soon as you come home you will be throwing a party the day you come back home from the hospital. Hope to see you soon.
